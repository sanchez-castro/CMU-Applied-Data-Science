 Applied Data Science Fellowship 2015

In this repository you will find all the work that was done in the fellowship in Carnegie Melon University in the summer of 2015. This course will give you a solid foundationÂ in the key elements of applied data science.
Co-taught by two Carnegie Mellon professors who specialize in data analysis and data visualization, the course digs deeply into applied data mining methodologies and classification techniques, data grouping and clustering, 
predictive models, and data visualization technologies and best practices, all with a focus on real-world cases and examples.
