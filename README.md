 Applied Data Science Fellowship 2015

In this repository you will find all the work that I done in the fellowship in Carnegie Melon University in the summer of 2015. This course provided  solid foundationÂ in  key elements of applied data science.
Co-taught by two Carnegie Mellon professors (Raja Sooriamurthi & Chris Labash) who specialize in data analysis and data visualization, the course dug deeply into applied data mining methodologies and classification techniques, data grouping and clustering, 
predictive models, and data visualization technologies and best practices, all with a focus on real-world cases and examples.
